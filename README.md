PF3D
====
PF3D is a Python module that facilitates volcanic ash dispersal modelling using the FALL3D package

##Project Description
Volcanic ash is the most widespread of all volcanic hazards and has the potential to affect hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of people across the Asia-Pacific region. Undertaking volcanic ash fallout hazard assessments is an important scientific, economic and political excercise and of great importance to public safety. One third of the worlds largest volcanic eruptions that have occured since 1800 have taken place within the Asia-Pacific region. There is limited information available for this region on the hazard posed by volcanic ash, particularly from volcanoes that have not erupted in recent times. The potential impacts of volcanic ash fallout are widespread, varying and highly dependant on the scale of the eruption and the distance of exposed communities from the source. 

There is a need for computational models capable of predicting volcanic ash dispersal both at ground level and suspended in the atmosphere when couple with field observations of historical or on-going activity. To maximise the effectiveness of such modles though should be readily accessible, easy to use and well tested. Geoscience Australia have been working since 2009 to develop a simplified user interface for an exisiting volcanic ash dispersal model (FALL3D) in python, named here PF3D. The purpose of PF3D is to enable the use of FALL3D for geoscientists with little of no programming background. 

##Development 
The open-source computational model PF3D was developed jointly between Geoscience Australia, the Australia-Indonesia Facility for Disaster Reduction, Badan Geologi (Indonesia's National Geological Agency) and the Philippines Institute of Volcanology and Seismology to assess the volcanic ash hazard on communites (with an emphasis on the Asia-Pacific region). PF3D is a python-based interface which wraps around the core dispersal model FALL3D and simplifies its use for those with little of no programming background. PF3D is currentl being used by geoscientists in Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Papua New Guinea to generate deterministic, probabilistic and forecast scenarios for volcanic ash which will ultimately improve our understanding of the potential impacts of ash from eruptions and inform disaster risk reduction efforts. PF3D is optimised for use on standard PC equipment as well as high performance computing platforms (e.g. National Computing Infrastructure (NCI)).
