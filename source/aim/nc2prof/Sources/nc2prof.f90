!*     This program reads several NCEP-1 reanalysis 4-dayly netCDF files 
!*     an extracts a profile at a given location. 
!*
!*     4-dayly NCEP-1 data files (or time subsets) can be download at:
!*     http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis.html
!*
!*     Space/Time subsets can be created when downloading (otherwise NCEP1 files cover 
!*     1 year and the globe). If the contents of a file is inconsistent 
!*     with the rest, the program will stop. Only the 4-observations-per-day files 
!*     are contemplated.
!*
!*     The program assumes a single file for variable, and MUST have the following names:
!*
!*     HGT.nc           Geopotential             (pressure file)
!*     TMP.nc           Temperature              (pressure file)
!*     UGRD.nc          u-velocity               (pressure file)
!*     VGRD.nc          v-velocity               (pressure file)
!*
!*     It is the user's responsability to download, rename and place these 11 files
!*     (or a dynamic link) to the same folder of the executable.
