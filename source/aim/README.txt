The Ash Impact Model (AIM) provides the following scripts and modules


install_fall3d.py:
    This script will unpack and install Fall3d-5.1.1.tgz which must 
    be obtained externally. Currently, the script will
    get this file from http://www.aifdr.org/projects/aim/.... FIXME 

    The environment variable FALL3DHOME can optionally be set to determine 
    the location of FALL3D. If omitted Fall3d will be installed under the 
    AIM area.
