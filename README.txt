Ash Impact Model (AIM) is a collection of Python scripts that facilitates 
volcanic ash impact modelling using the Fall3d package.

They are developed for use with the 
Australia-Indonesia Facility for Disaster Reduction (AIFDR) in Jakarta and
are aimed at the Ubuntu Jaunty operating environment but they
may be useful to a broader audience. 

See README.txt in the source and testing directories for more details.
