PF3D - Volcanic Ash Modelling
=====================================

PF3D is a Python module that facilitates volcanic ash hazard modelling using the Fall3D package http://bsccase02.bsc.es/projects/fall3d

PF3D (python-FALL3D) was developed jointly between Geoscience Australia (GA) and the Australia-
Indonesia Facility for Disaster Reduction (AIFDR) and modifies the modelling procedure of
FALL3D to simplify its use for those with no background in computational modelling. Three
modelling procedures are available through a unified interface: scenario-based modelling (single
event), hazard mapping (probabilistic wind) and forecasting (predictive). 

PF3D outputs are geospatially referenced in a standard format and can be viewed alongside other datasets
important for impact and risk analysis such as: population density, exposure of the built environment
and crop extents. The hazard maps produced contour connecting points of equal volcanic ash
thicknesses (or ash load: mass per unit area; or ash concentration: volume per unit area). Each map
may contain contours of volcanic ash thicknesses/load that vary in appearance according to the
volcanological and meteorological conditions during the eruption. Collectively these hazard maps
are intended for use by government agencies to assess the risk of volcanic ash for communities.
